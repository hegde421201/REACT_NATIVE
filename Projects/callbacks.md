# Callback functions in JavaScript

Callback functions including those used in React Native, work similarly to how callbacks work in other languages, like Java.

They allow you to pass a function as an argument to another function,
and that passed function is executed at a later time, often after some asynchronous operation or event.
This is a fundamental concept in JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations.

## Here's how callback functions work in JavaScript and how they resemble callbacks in Java:

1. Passing a Function as an Argument

---

In JavaScript: You can pass a function as an argument to another function just like any other data type.
In Java: You can pass an object or interface that defines the method (a callback) to be executed later.

2. Execution After an Asynchronous Operation

---

In JavaScript: Callback functions are often used to handle asynchronous tasks like making API calls, reading files, or handling user interactions.
In Java: Callbacks are commonly used in event-driven programming, such as handling user input or responding to events in a graphical user interface.

3. Resemblance to Java

---

In both JavaScript and Java, callbacks are a way to achieve asynchronous and event-driven behavior. They allow you to specify what should happen when an operation is completed or an event occurs.
In Java, you might use interfaces or listeners to define callback methods. In JavaScript, you directly pass functions as callbacks.

4. Example javascript

---

function fetchDataFromServer(callback) {
// Simulate an asynchronous operation
setTimeout(function() {
const data = 'Some data from the server';
callback(data); // Execute the callback function with the data
}, 1000);
}

function processData(data) {
console.log('Processing data:', data);
}

fetchDataFromServer(processData);

5. example Java

---

public interface DataListener {
void onDataReceived(String data);
}

public class Server {
public void fetchDataFromServer(DataListener listener) {
// Simulate an asynchronous operation
new Thread(() -> {
String data = "Some data from the server";
listener.onDataReceived(data); // Execute the callback method with the data
}).start();
}
}

public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Server server = new Server();

    server.fetchDataFromServer(new DataListener() {
      @Override
      public void onDataReceived(String data) {
        System.out.println("Processing data: " + data);
      }
    });

}
}
In both cases, a callback function or method is provided to handle the data once it's available.
This allows your code to continue executing other tasks while waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete.
